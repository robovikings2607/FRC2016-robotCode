CompBot 2016 Control Scheme

Driver Controls
	self-explanatory
	
Operator Controls
	Button A (1) - Roll in
	Button Y (4) - Roll out
	Button B (2) - Toggle claw open/close
	Left Bumper (5) - tighten puncher
	Right Bumper (6) - loosen puncher
	Left Trigger (2) - locks the puncher
	Right Trigger (1) - shoot the puncher
	Up on the left stick - raise the arm
	Down on the left stick - lower the arm
	
Arm Positioning:
	Talon encoder provides count of cim motor revs, forward >0, negative <0
		encoder is reversed, so must use CANTalon.reverseSensor(true) to keep encoder and motor in phase
		(i.e. postive voltage causes position to increase, negative voltage cause position to decrease)
	Forward (postive) voltage cause gearbox output to spin counter-clockwise when you look at it head on; or in other words
		if you're looking at a side view with the cim to the left and the shaft to the right, forward means shaft spins towards you
	Forward (positive) voltage will lower arm (motor is mounted on left of arm)
		
	350 cim revs equates to 360deg of arm travel
	deg/rev = 360/350
	so, to travel Xdeg, number of revs required is ((350 * Xdeg) / 360)
	will need to set soft limits in Talon for protection
