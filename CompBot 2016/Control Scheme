For additional tuning:
- make PuncherArm loggable
- update web pages to graph PuncherArm
	- also graph the generated profile
	- check what position of last profile point is vs target position (i.e. is the profile getting us all the way to target?)
		- can push last position to SmartDashboard
		
Testing to do:

4) confirm that disabling and re-enabling is safe (e.g. transition from auto to teleop)
	a) with winder homing in progress, disable and re-enable;  shooter should resume and complete homing, and end 
	up enabled (able to shoot)
	b) with re-cock sequence in progress, disable and re-enable;  shooter should resume and complete sequence, and 
	end up able to shoot	 
	c) with arm homing in progress, disable.  Should see abort message on console
		1) upon re-enabling, arm should stay disabled and wait to operator to re-initiate homing
	d) with arm MP in progress, disable
		1) upon re-enabling, arm should stay in current position and you should be able to move as normal (profile
		should handle current position)

CompBot 2016 Control Scheme

Driver Controls
	self-explanatory
		- left stick Y axis is forward/reverse, right stick X axis is left/right turn
	right stick button is shift
		- code defaults to high gear (solenoid set to true on init) 
	start button is auton mode select
	Button A is auto-turn
	Button B is auto-turn with WPILib PIDController
	Button Y is rotate arm to manualArmAngle from SmartDashboard
		
Operator Controls follow MikeyBear's Dream Control Scheme 

	Right Trigger: 	Shoot and re-cock shooter 
		- controller will rumble if you try to shoot and claw isn't opened

	Left Trigger:	Lock the arm (interrupt any running MP, and engage lock)

	Left and Right Bumpers - Rollers in and out

  	DPad Up:  	arm highest position (-66.535)
  	DPad Left: 	arm courtyard shot position (-45.69)
  	DPad Right:	arm outerworks shot position (-43)
  	DPad Down:	arm fully down (0) 

	Button A:	aim arm per vision tracking
	Button B:	Toggle Claw open/closed
	Button X:	arm position 4 (slightly off floor)
	Button Y:   manual arm unlock
	
	Start button:  press and hold to execute shooter homing procedure....
		- needs to be run if robot booted with shooter not fully cocked
		- only runs if shooter's not enabled
		- if you release the start button before the shooter reaches home, it'll abort and you have to re-run
	
	Back button:  press to execute arm homing procedure
			
Maintenance Controls (Test Mode)

	Right Bumper (6) - tighten winder (motor spins reverse/negative voltage; encoder position decreases)
	Left Bumper (5) - loosen winder (motor spins forward/positive voltage; encoder position increases)

	Left Trigger (axis 2) - lock the puncher 
	Right Trigger (axis 3) - shoot the puncher 

	Button A (1) - lower the arm 5 degrees
	Button Y (4) - lift the arm 5 degrees

	Button B (2) - Toggle claw open/close
	
TODO:
1) handle loss of winder encoder position when moving up to grab; the following may work
	- current position less than prior, we've lost position....jump to step 3 in sequence which stops, grabs, and runs shooter back to home
	position.  From there operator may need to shoot to re-cock if we weren't far enough forward to grab when we jumped to step 3

2) handle interrupting current arm profile and starting another one
	a) in Robot, remove check for isArmWaiting() from dpad conditions
	b) update ArmPositioningThread (checkAndRotateArm(), lockArm()) to handle interruption
		- will need to add steps to state machine
		- lockArm()
			- if arm is currently moving, stop & clear profile, and engage brake once MP is clear (talon disabled)
			- if arm isn't moving, engage brake 
		
3) (due to the above 2 changes where we're interrupting state machines, implement states as AtomicInteger to avoid
concurrency issues....do this for RobovikingSRXProfileDriver as well)
	a) RobovikingSRXProfileDriver
		
4) vibrate oController if operator runs rollers but claw is open

5) increase arm speed
	 
Arm Positioning:
	Talon encoder provides count of cim motor revs, forward >0, reverse <0
		encoder is reversed, so must use CANTalon.reverseSensor(true) to keep encoder and motor in phase
		(i.e. postive voltage causes position to increase, negative voltage cause position to decrease)

	Forward (postive) voltage cause gearbox output to spin counter-clockwise when you look at it head on; or in other words
		if you're looking at a side view with the cim to the left and the shaft to the right, forward means shaft spins towards you
	
	Motor is mounted on left of arm and attached via an addition gear, so therefore:
		Forward (positive) voltage will rotate arm towards front of robot (down) 
		Reverse (negative) voltage will rotate arm towards rear of robot  (up)
		
	350 cim revs equates to 360deg of arm travel:  i.e. deg/rev = 360/350
	so, to travel Xdeg, number of revs required is ((350 * Xdeg) / 360)

	let currentArmPos = rotations up from 0 (bottom);  is therefore always <= 0 when arm is not "home"
		- remember, running motor in reverse raises the arm, forward lowers the arm

	if we have a set of known positions (in # of negative rotations), we
	can generate a profile to take us from current position to selected target
	- e.g. start at 0, rotate to position -47 (move arm up)
		- total distance is -47 (-(current - target))
	
	- start at position -47, rotate to position -20 (move arm down)
		- total distance is 27 = (-(current - target)) 
		= (-(-47 -(-20))) 
		= -(-47 + 20) 
		= -(-27)
		= 27
		
	- start at position -20, rotate to position -47 (move arm up)
		= -(-20 -(-47))
		= -(-20 + 47)
		= -(27)

	- start at position 0, rotate to position -47 (move arm up)
		= -(0 - (-47))
		= -(47)

	- start at position -47, rotate to position 0 (move arm down)
		= -(-47 - 0)
		= -(-47)
		
	arm start-up:
		- if photoeye is true, that means the arm is not fully down;  arm position control needs to stay disabled
		
	an example for converting from a vision angle: given that forward motor travel rotates arm towards front, measure like a protractor:  
		Consider 90deg as straight up, 180 as flat pointing out the front of the robot, and 0 as flat pointing out the rear
		of the robot 	
		Have vision targeting report target angle between 90 and 180;  e.g. subtract triangulated aim angle from 180
		
	To calculate degrees to travel to change aim:
		subtract current angle from target angle, and travel that far in that direction
	
	For example:
		current angle is 90deg, target angle is 110deg (70deg elevation pointing out front of robot)
			travelDegrees = 110 - 90 = 20deg
		current angle is 110, target angle is 70deg (70deg elevation pointing out back of robot)
			travelDegrees = 70 - 110 = -40deg  
	
	soft limits in Talon don't provide for reliable protection when used with MPE:
		- if position is relative and is reset on each profile, obviously the limits would never be
		triggered
		- if using absolute position and not resetting on each profile, the MPE seems to go wonky 
		when a limit is tripped
			- with limit fault tripped, the next profile in the opposite direction doesn't run; need
			to send it twice
			- there's no way in Java to poll the fault, the WPI methods currently return JNI exceptions
			which crashes the robot code

	see about detecting stall to protect against lowering too far (hitting frame / floor)
		
	42 degrees is the optimal angle for shooting into the high goal from the edge of the outer works
